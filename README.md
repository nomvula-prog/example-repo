# User Information Program

## Description

This is a simple Python program that collects basic user information using input prompts and then displays the information in a readable sentence.

The program asks the user for:

* Name
* Age
* House number
* Street name

It then prints a sentence using the provided details.

## How the Program Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their name.
2. The user is prompted to enter their age.
3. The user is prompted to enter their house number.
4. The user is prompted to enter their street name.
5. The program combines the inputs and prints them as a single sentence.

## Requirements

* Python 3 installed on your computer

## How to Run the Program

1. Save the file as `user_info.py` (or any name ending with `.py`).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
4. Run the program using:



## Example Output

```
Name: John
Age: 25
House number: 12
Street name: Main Street
Your name is John you are 25 old live in 12 Main Street
```

## Notes

* The program currently treats all inputs as strings.
* A commented-out alternative using an f-string is included in the code for cleaner formatting.
